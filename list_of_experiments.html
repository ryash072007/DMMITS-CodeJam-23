                    <h2>SITE - Satellite Instructional Television Experiment</h2>
                    <p class="slide_content">
                        One of the first major experiments conducted was the SITE operation. ISRO wanted to test out
                        sattelite capabilities in a time where it was still in its primitive form.
                        In order to achieve this goal and to help the rural people of India, the SITE operation was
                        launched in 1975. The SITE operation involved broadcasting information related to science,
                        literature, and, finance to people in over 2000 villages.
                        This operation is also credited with training 50,000 primary science teachers and helped over
                        200,000 people. Thus it was considered as the largest sociological experiment in the world at
                        that time.

                        Mars Orbiter Mission - Mangalyaan

                    <p class="slide_content">
                        The Mars Orbiter Mission was the first interplanetary mission conducted by India and waas
                        launched in november of 2013. This was the first Mars Mission to succeed in its first attempt in
                        the world and the first asian country to do so.
                        It was launched using a PSLV rocket and took 298 days to reach Mars. It is the least expensive
                        Mars mission to date at around 450 crore rupees. This was only possible beacuse the team behind
                        the mission decided to use a modular system for it.

                    </h2>
                    <p class="slide_content">
                        INSAT was commissioned in 1983 with the launch of INSAT-1B. It was a revolutionary system at
                        that time and continues to be a pillar for broadcasting sector in India. It brought forward a
                        television and audio revolution in India to where it is now. It is a thick network of 11
                        sattelites that are monitored and controlled by Master Control Facilities present in Bhopal and
                        Hassan.
                        The INSAT sattelites' provides threee diffrent electromagnetic bands for various purposes. The
                        INSAT system also enables India to recieve SOS messages from the South Asian and Indian Ocean
                        for search and rescue missions.
