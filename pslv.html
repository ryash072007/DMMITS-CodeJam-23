                    PSLV is the third generation of launch vehicles of ISRO and is the first to be equipped with liquid
                    stages instead of solid stages compared to the previous two generations. This enables it to carry over 1500 kilograms of payload.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's maiden launch was in 1994 where it quickly established itself as a very reliable and cheap
                    launch vehicle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has been responsible for many indian and foreign satellite launches such as Chandrayaan-1 and
                    Mangalyaan that travelled to the moon and mars respectively, and singaporean satellites - DS-EO,
                    NeuSAR and SCOOB-1 due to its multi-payload capability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Out of its 58 launches, the PSLV has had 55 successes, 2 failures, and 1 partial success making it
                    one of the most reliable rockets in the world and earning it the title "The workhorse of ISRO".
