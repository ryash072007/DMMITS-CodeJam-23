                    PSLV is the third generation of launch vehicles of ISRO and is the first to be equipped with liquid
                    stages instead of solid stages compared to the previous two generations.

                    Mangalyaan that travelled to the moon and mars respectively, and singaporean satellites - DS-EO,
                    NeuSAR and SCOOB-1 due to its multi-payload capability.
