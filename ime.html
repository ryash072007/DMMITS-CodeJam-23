            Satellite Telecommunication Experiments Project (STEP) was the next step forward. A key objective of STEP was to conduct a system test of geosynchronous satellites for domestic communication, enhance capabilities, and gain experience in designing, fabricating, installing, operating, and maintaining a variety of ground segment facilities that would all result in INSAT's production and operation.
